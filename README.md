# Ignition-Interlock-Project

Summary
The Alcohol-Impaired Driving Detection System is a comprehensive safety solution designed to prevent alcohol-impaired individuals from operating a vehicle. This project integrates advanced technologies and components to detect the driver's state and take appropriate actions.

Key Features:

Facial Detection: Utilizes computer vision to analyze the driver's facial expressions and detect signs of impairment.

Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) Measurement: Incorporates an MQ-3 alcohol sensor to measure BAC levels, providing an additional layer of accuracy.

Ignition Control: Prevents the vehicle's ignition from starting when impairment is detected, ensuring the driver's safety and that of others on the road.

GPS Integration: Utilizes GPS data to provide location information, allowing for real-time tracking and notifications.

GSM Communication: Sends text messages to a predetermined contact in case of impairment, informing them of the driver's condition and location.

LED Feedback: Uses green and red LEDs to provide visual feedback on ignition status, enhancing user awareness.

Open Source: This project is open-source, enabling collaboration and improvement by the developer community.

Legal and Ethical Considerations: Please note that the project is intended for educational and experimental purposes. It is important to consider legal and ethical implications when developing and deploying such systems.

Hardware Requirements: Raspberry Pi (or similar), webcam, MQ-3 alcohol sensor, GPS module, GSM module, and LEDs.

Project Status: This project is under active development. Contributions, feedback, and collaboration are welcome.

Disclaimer: This project is intended for educational purposes and as a technology demonstration. It is essential to follow all local laws and regulations related to alcohol-impaired driving and to prioritize road safety at all times.
